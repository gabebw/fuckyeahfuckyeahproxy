## You probably shouldn't use this
The easiest way to get Campfire to think a URL is an image is to add "#.jpg" to
the end of it. You should probably do that instead.

## What?
fuckyeah.herokuapp.com doesn't ignore .jpg at the end of the url, so I made this
proxy for it.

## Why?
So that Campfire recognizes fuck-yeah URLs as images.
